\arguments{
\item{df}{One row individual-year-of-life data}

\item{interactions_l}{A subset of interaction data}

\item{min_cores_days}{The minimum number of coresidence days needed for dyad to be included. Defaults to 60 days.}

\item{within_grp}{Logical value indicating whether regressions should be fit relative to dyads in entire population (default) or to dyads within-group}
